In their console they would like to be able to:
DONE-Create and Save Artists
DONE-Create and Save Albums
DONE-List All Artists/Albums
DONE-List all the albums they have by an artist
DONE-Show the artist any album belongs to
DONEEvery artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

Further tasks
Additionally it would be nice to be able to:
-Edit Artists/Albums
DONE-Delete Artists/Albums
DONE-Find Artists/Albums by their ID
-Remember to regularly git commit!
